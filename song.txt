Legends never die
When the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Relentless you survive

They never lose hope when everything's cold and the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones they'll run into smoke when the fire is fierce
Oh pick yourself up, â€˜cause
